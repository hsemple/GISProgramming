Once you have masterd basic concepts in Python, you are ready to take on the libraries. Here is a list of some of the popular open source libraries used in the geospatial community. The list is in no paraticualr order. Selection of particular libraries depend on the task that needs to be carried out.   


* [Geopandas.](https://geopandas.org/#description) Great tool for easy reading and display of vector data.
* [GDAL/OGR.](https://gdal.org/) - A package used by many GIS applications for raster and vector processing. 
* [Rasterio.](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Simplifies working with raster datasets procssing
* [PyProj.0](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/)  Widely used tool for cartographic transformations and geodetic computations
* [Cartopy.](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html) Cartography library
* [Fiona.](https://pypi.org/project/Fiona/) Reads and write spatial data. 
* [Shapely.](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) Great for reading and writing spatial data.
* [GEOS.](https://pypi.org/project/geos/). Library for creating Google Earth overlays of tiled maps.
* [pyshp.](https://pypi.org/project/pyshp/) Reads and writes ESRI shapefiles
* [GeoDjango.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/gis/) Used for building geospatial web applications 
* [EarthPy.](https://pypi.org/project/earthpy/) Simplifies processing of raster and vector data.
* [GeoPy.](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Geocoding library
* [PySAL.](https://pysal.org/) Used for spatial statistical analysis. 
* [RSGISLib.](https://www.rsgislib.org/index.html#python-documentation) Remote Sensing Library
* [Geoplot.](https://geopandas.org/gallery/plotting_with_geoplot.html). Used for plotting maps and several GIS operations.
